                    <p><strong>"Faded Memory"</strong><br>Procreate<br>This piece aims to capture the feeling of an old photograph; something distant but familiar. I created this because to me, nostalgia is one of the best feelings and I hope to invoke it with this drawing.</p>

                    <p><strong>"Stalker"</strong><br>Procreate<br>An early attempt at pixel art where I focused on creating detail out of very little information. I wanted to create something extra-terrestrial with minimal detail, letting the atmosphere carry the mood.</p>

                    <p><strong>"At Least it's Exercise"</strong><br>Blender<br>This project was an experiment in lighting and atmosphere. I wanted to create a scene that felt unsettling, using lighting and shadows to emphasize movement and create a liminal-space.</p>

                    <p><strong>"Sign of the Times"</strong><br>Woodworking and painting<br>This was made purely as a visual piece, combining painting and woodworking to create something eye-catching. I enjoyed the physical aspect of this and hope to do something similar in the future.</p>

                    <p><strong>"Spring Morning"</strong><br>MPC Beats<br>A layered track inspired by hearing birds singing in the morning. The soft textures and slow build aim to capture the quiet calm feeling of waking up in a comforting cottage house without a care in the world.</p>

                    <p><strong>"Stroll"</strong><br>FL Studio<br>A Bossanova influenced piece meant to feel relaxed and easygoing. The chords and gentle groove make it a laid-back listen. My initial vision for this was to use it as a background for an animation, but I liked it too much as a standalone song.</p>
